# Hi!
Hi, I'm Sean, a 3rd-year computer science major who is currently focusing on games and game engines.  
Over the past couple of years I've gained experience with modern 3D graphics APIs and making games from the ground-up.  

**Some notable things I've built for my projects are:**
- Deferred and forward renderers
- Entity component systems
- Material and effect systems
- Various optimized file formats for assets and other data
- Various acceleration structures and memory allocators
- And more... Feel free to check out my pinned projects for more details!
